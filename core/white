### 3.4 Token Health System

The NEST platform implements a sophisticated token health system that monitors and manages the viability of AI tokens:

#### Health Mechanics
- Each token has a health score (0-100)
- Health decays when market cap falls below threshold
- Recovery occurs when market cap rises above threshold
- Automatic burning triggers at critical health levels

#### Market Cap Thresholds
- Individual thresholds based on token generation
- Higher generations require higher thresholds
- Dynamic adjustment based on market conditions

#### Burning Mechanism
When a token's health reaches critical levels:
1. Token is automatically converted to parent token
2. 80% value preservation in conversion
3. Holder receives parent tokens automatically
4. Original token is permanently burned

#### Recovery System
- Health recovers at 50% of decay rate when above threshold
- Recovery rate scales with market cap excess
- Maximum health capped at 100%

This system ensures:
- Market cap maintenance
- Ecosystem health
- Value preservation
- Automatic rebalancing
